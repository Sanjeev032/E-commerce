# E-commerce
A fully responsive, user-friendly E-commerce website frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to replicate the look and feel of a real online store, complete with product listings, category filters, and shopping cart functionality â€” all handled on the front-end without any frameworks or backend.
This project is a part of my web development learning journey and focuses on building the front-facing part of an online shopping platform. It highlights the use of semantic HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsive design, and Vanilla JavaScript for interactive features like:

Adding and removing products from the cart

Filtering products by category

Real-time search functionality

Dynamic cart updates and total pricing

The website is designed to be clean, minimal, and responsive across devices, making it a strong foundation for future backend integration and feature enhancements.
